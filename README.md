# Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means

## About the Project
In this project, I performed customer segmentation using the Mall Customers dataset. 
The goal is to group customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score.

This helps businesses understand different types of customers and create better marketing strategies.

## Dataset Information
Dataset: Mall_Customers.csv

Features used:
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## Steps I Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Selected important features
3. Scaled the data using StandardScaler
4. Used the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
5. Applied K-Means clustering
6. Visualized the customer segments

## Result
The model divided customers into 5 different clusters.
Each cluster represents a different type of customer behavior.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
